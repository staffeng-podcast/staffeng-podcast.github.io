Conversations with software engineers who have progressed beyond the career level, into Staff levels and beyond. We discuss the areas of work that set Staff-plus level engineers apart from other individual contributors; things like setting technical direction, mentorship and sponsorship, providing engineering perspective to the org, etc. Hosted by David Noël-Romas ([@davidnoelromas](https://x.com/davidnoelromas)) and Alex Kessinger ([@voidfiles](https://x.com/voidfiles)).
